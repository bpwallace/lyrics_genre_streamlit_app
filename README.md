# lyrics_genre_streamlit_app
I built a model that classifies song lyrics into genres. I was able to deploy it very easily using streamlit.

It uses a simple logistic regression model. I was limitted to the size of my data or I would deployed a neural network as I believe it could have achieved greater accuracies.

I have the code in place for 90% of the data pipeline to build a larger dataset I just need to input a dataframe containing artists and song names.
